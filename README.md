# Food101

A project for training and evaluating food classification models using **PyTorch**, **MLflow**,  **Hydra** and **Streamlit**.

This project demonstrates a full **MLOps pipeline**: from automated data preparation, training, experiment tracking, and model selection, to testing and deployment of a live demo. All stages are designed to **maximize reproducibility and automation**, allowing you to run experiments, evaluate results, and deploy models with minimal manual intervention.

> This project is inspired by the course [PyTorch for Deep Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/pytorch-for-deep-learning/) by **Daniel Bourke** and **Andrei Neagoie**.

> **Note:** The pipeline is compatible with **any image classification dataset** that follows the same folder structure as `data/dataset/` (i.e., `train/`, `val/`, and `test/` folders, each containing one subfolder per class with images inside). You can replace the Food101 data with your own dataset as long as you keep this structure.

## 🧠 Supported Model Architectures

This project supports the following model architectures out of the box:

- **EfficientNet B0 & B2:**  
  EfficientNet models are known for their excellent balance between accuracy and efficiency, using a compound scaling method to optimize depth, width, and resolution.  
  - *B0* is the baseline model, lightweight and fast.
  - *B2* is slightly larger, offering improved accuracy at a modest computational cost.

- **MobileNet V2:**  
  MobileNetV2 is a lightweight model designed for mobile and embedded vision applications. It uses depthwise separable convolutions and inverted residuals to achieve high efficiency with good accuracy.

You can easily add more architectures by extending the model loading logic in the codebase. The modular design allows for quick integration of any PyTorch-compatible model.

## 🚀 How to Use

You can use this project in **two ways**:

---

### Option 1: Run Only the Demo App

If you just want to try the app with already trained models (no need to run the full pipeline):

1. **Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tu_usuario/food101Mini.git
    cd food101Mini
    conda create -n food101 python=3.10
    conda activate food101
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. **Make sure you have the trained models available locally.**

    The folder `selected_models/` must exist on your machine. We included three trained models that can be used for predictions in the whole Food101 dataset.

3. **Launch the demo app:**

    ```bash
    make demo
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

---

### Option 2: Full MLOps Pipeline (Reproducible Training & Evaluation)

Run the entire pipeline from data preparation to model selection and testing using the provided `makefile` commands.

#### **Step-by-step Pipeline**

| Command              | Description                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `make prepare`       | Prepare the dataset                  |
| `make experiments`   | Run all experiments                  |
| `make select`        | Select top models                    |
| `make test`          | Test selected models                 |
| `make demo`          | Launch Streamlit demo (if available) |
| `make clean`         | Remove outputs and logs              |
| `make ui`            | Launch MLflow UI                     |
| `make help`          | Show all available commands          |

**Example usage:**

```bash
make prepare
make experiments
make select
make test
make demo
```

> This makes it much easier to run the full pipeline without typing long commands.

### 📑 Configuration-driven Workflow

The pipeline is **highly configurable** via YAML files in the `conf/` folder.  
You can control every stage of the workflow, including advanced training features:

- **Experiments (`conf/experiments.yaml`):**
  - **Model selection:** Choose architectures, pretrained weights, and number of classes.
  - **Train:** Set learning rate, batch size, optimizer, epochs, and more.
  - **Schedulers:**  
    Use learning rate schedulers (`StepLR` and `ReduceLROnPlateau`) by specifying the scheduler type and its parameters.  
    Example:
    ```yaml
    train:
      scheduler: 
        type: ReduceLROnPlateau            # Options: None, ReduceLROnPlateau, StepLR
        step_size: 5
        gamma: 0.5
        patience: 2
    ```
  - **Early stopping:**  
    Enable early stopping to halt training when validation performance stops improving.  
    Example:
    ```yaml
    train:
      early_stop_patience: 4
    ```
  - **Checkpointing:**  
    Automatically saves the best model (based on loss) during training.  

  - **Reproducibility:** Set random seeds for deterministic results.

- **Model Selection (`conf/select_models.yaml`):**
  - Choose how many top models to keep (`top_k`).
  - Select the metric for ranking models (e.g., accuracy, F1, etc.).
  - Define source and destination folders for selected models.

- **Testing (`conf/test.yaml`):**
  - Set batch size, device (`cpu` or `cuda`), and which metrics to compute.
  Example  
  ```yaml
  runs_dir: "selected_models" 
  batch_size: 32         
  save_results: true      
  device: cuda
  loss_fn: CrossEntropyLoss
  metrics: ["accuracy", "precision_macro", "recall_macro", "f1_macro"]
  save_cm_img: False
  ```

All results and artifacts are tracked with MLflow (`mlruns/`).

### ⚠️ Important Note for Full Pipeline

If you want to run the **full pipeline** (starting from data preparation with `make prepare`), make sure to **delete the `selected_models/` folder** after cloning the repository.  
This is important because if `selected_models/` exists from a previous run (possibly with different classes), it may cause errors or inconsistencies when preparing a new dataset with different classes.

You can safely remove it with:

```bash
rm -rf selected_models
```
or on Windows:
```cmd
rmdir /s /q selected_models
```

Then proceed with the pipeline as usual:

```bash
make prepare
make experiments
make select
make test
make demo
```

---

### ⚡️ Orchestrate the Full Pipeline with a Single Command

You can also run the **entire pipeline automatically** using the provided `orchestrator` script.  
This script will execute all the main steps (prepare, experiments, select, test, etc.) in the correct order.

Simply run:

```bash
make run
```
or
```bash
python -m scripts.orchestrator
```

This is especially useful for reproducibility, automation, or when running the pipeline on a new dataset from scratch.
